Project 4:
Run P4init.m, then open and run the Project_4.slx, then open and run Project_4_Run.m. Currently having an issue with the brake logic function and the car is in violation of the regen logic leading to a "true" boolean appearing in the console. Not quite sure why its triggering this, everything else seems to be working, and was working before adding this feature into the simulink model.
